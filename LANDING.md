## Hero

### Headline
**Living Memory for Agents**

### Subhead
Wholistic memory framework that evolves, connects, and never goes stale.

### Tagline options
- *Memory that thinks.*
- *Not RAG. Memory.*
- *Agents remember. Finally.*

---

## Problem

### Section: The Amnesia Problem

**Agents forget.**

Every conversation starts from zero. Context evaporates. Preferences vanish. Decisions made yesterday are unknown today.

Current solutions? They call it "memory" but it's just RAG with extra steps.

- **Stateless by default** — no persistence between sessions
- **Dump and retrieve** — no understanding, just keyword matching
- **Contradictions pile up** — no cleanup, no curation
- **Identity fragmented** — context lives in silos

Your agent knows you for 10 minutes. Then amnesia.

---

## Solution

### Section: Hyper9

**Memory that lives.**

Hyper9 is a wholistic memory framework built on ontology, not retrieval hacks.

| RAG-as-Memory | Hyper9 |
|---------------|--------|
| Stores chunks | Stores atoms |
| Retrieves text | Retrieves knowledge |
| Static dump | Living graph |
| Single context | Identity across contexts |
| Passive | Actively curated |

## The Concept: HYPER MEMORY

### Not Human-Like. Better.

The goal isn't to give agents memory "like humans have."

Human memory is:
- Lossy — we forget most things
- Biased — we remember what feels important, not what is
- Slow — recall degrades over time
- Isolated — trapped in one brain

Why replicate limitations?

**HYPER MEMORY is 100x better.**

| Human Memory | HYPER MEMORY |
|--------------|--------------|
| Forgets | Never loses |
| Decays | Actively maintained |
| Isolated | Shared, connected |
| Passive | Self-organizing |
| Retrieval by association | Retrieval by meaning + structure |
| One perspective | Multi-agent consensus |

### What Makes It HYPER

**Pollinating** — Every new fact propagates through the graph. Connections form automatically. Related atoms cluster. Patterns surface without being asked.

**Hydrating** — Sparse facts get enriched. Missing metadata fills in. Weak links strengthen. The graph grows denser, more useful.

**Updating** — No stale data. Contradictions trigger resolution. Old facts get superseded. The graph reflects current truth, not historical accumulation.

**Pruning** — Low-value atoms decay. Orphans get removed. The graph stays lean. Signal-to-noise improves over time.

**Consolidating** — Granular facts roll up into patterns. Patterns become rules. The graph abstracts itself into higher-order knowledge.

Memory that maintains itself. Memory that improves itself. Memory that thinks.

## Core Ideas

### Living Memory

Memory isn't a database. It's an organism.

Hyper9 memory gets **pollinated** — new facts connect to existing knowledge. It gets **hydrated** — enriched with context and metadata. It **evolves** — outdated atoms decay, patterns emerge, contradictions resolve.

Memory never stalls.

### Ontology-Based

Not a vector store with extra features. A knowledge graph with structure.

```
Identity → Contexts → Knowledge → Decisions → Patterns
```

Every atom has a type. Every connection has meaning. Agents reason over structure, not similarity scores.

### Active Curation

Multiple agents maintain the memory:

- **Discovery** — find patterns humans missed
- **Enrichment** — strengthen weak connections
- **Validation** — flag stale or uncertain facts
- **Cleanup** — prune contradictions, merge duplicates
- **Consolidation** — roll up facts into insights

Memory cleans itself.

### Identity Across Contexts

One identity. Many contexts.

Context filtered memory.

Your preferences in Project A connect to your patterns in Domain B. Agents understand *you*, not just the current conversation.

---

## HYPER GRAPH

The interface to your memory.

### See Everything

Not a black box. A graph you can navigate, understand, and trust.

- **Explore** — traverse nodes, follow edges, zoom in/out
- **Search** — find atoms by content, type, context
- **Filter** — slice by time, importance, category
- **Trace** — follow provenance to source

### Curate Manually

Agents maintain the graph. Humans correct it.

- **Edit** — fix wrong facts, update stale knowledge
- **Connect** — add missing links, strengthen relations
- **Remove** — delete what shouldn't exist
- **Verify** — confirm uncertain atoms, resolve conflicts

Clean interface. Full control.

### Collaborate

Same graph. Multiple actors.

Agents write. Humans review. Agents learn from corrections. The graph converges on truth.

---

## Memory Interface

Tools to interact:

- `remember` — store new knowledge
- `recall` — retrieve relevant context
- `forget` — delete specific memories
- `verify` — confirm uncertain facts
- `explore` — browse the graph

Ships as MCP server. Drop into any agent.

---

## Built on HelixDB

HYPER MEMORY runs on **HelixDB** — a graph database built for AI workloads.

- **Native vectors** — embeddings live in the graph, not a sidecar
- **Graph + vector** — combine structure and similarity in one query
- **Fast** — optimized for agent-speed retrieval
- **Simple** — clean query language, no ceremony

The right foundation for living memory.

---

## Technical

- **Atomic** — single claim per memory unit
- **Updateable** — supersede, don't duplicate
- **Observable** — audit every read and write
- **Private** — workspace isolation, deletion by design

## Short Versions

### One-liner
Hyper9: Living memory framework for agents — ontology-based, actively curated, never stale.

### Tweet-length
Agents forget everything. Current "memory" solutions are just RAG in disguise. Hyper9 builds living knowledge graphs that evolve, connect identity across contexts, and clean themselves. Memory that thinks.

### Elevator pitch
Every AI agent has amnesia. They forget your preferences, lose context, can't connect decisions across conversations. Hyper9 fixes this with a living memory framework — not retrieval, actual knowledge. Ontology-based atoms that connect, agents that curate and clean the graph, identity that persists across contexts. Memory that maintains itself.
